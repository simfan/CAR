v 1.0;

What this does:
This code allows for the creation, modification, and viewing of Corrective Action Requests (CARs from here on out).

All of the viewable pages are on this main level.

car.php - This is the main form.  It will allow a user to create or edit a CAR.

All subfolders will have their own readme file.
